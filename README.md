# Custom character Tic Tac Toe
I would like to introduce my version of Tic Tac Toe to the world. It's inspired by games with customizable avatars and cosmetics, allowing you to express yourself in whatever manner you'd like. Unfortunately the time I was hoping to dedicate to this project was unavailable. However, this project is by no means finished and I will continue to add features such as a bot with two difficulties, local storage, another game variant and perhaps multiplayer.

A twist on a classic Tic Tac Toe game with the ability to customize player

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem solving
- Used a mix of writing my thought process alongside some pseodocode for naming and such.
- Code was originally really DRY and complicated which took me a while to re-write and improve upon.
- Many issues were faced when it came to applying custom names and images, allowing it to work seamlessly and revert back to the original image when a new game began.

## :rocket: Tools used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery library

## :frown: Bugs to fix
- Using a placeholder for the name of the images instead of the image link
- The animations for the strikethrough will not work if you click 'Play again' before the strikethrough fully animates.


## :sob: Lessons learnt
- The benefits of planning.
- The importance of pseudocode and formatting your code neatly to make it more readable and DRY.
- How to animate objects.
- How to create a game that keeps track of values and can be played continuously.
- How to change values and images dependant on the users input.

## :green_check_mark: Future features
- More reactive animations and styling.
- 4x4 and 5x5 game modes.
- Navigation bar to change between 3x3 and 4x4.
- An optional bot.
- Online multiplayer.
- Local storage.
